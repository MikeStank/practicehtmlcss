		<p>This is my practice website. </p>

		<p> If I don't learn this I will be screwed for the homework that is due next Sunday. </p>

 		<p> So I guess this is why this is my new website, to learn and to develop my brain squirrel. 
 
 		<p> I'll probably be linking CSS to this pretty soon. </p>	

 		<p> Need to make sure I learn how to do all this quick and easy.</p>	

		 <p> I'm nervous about getting the positioning and layout though. But we'll be cool eventually.</p>

		<p>After a long day of practing, eating, drinking, breathing, and preparing to eat Pho, I go back to practicing.</p>
		<p>I sit in my chair and wonder, "Will I begin to understand and remember everything that I need to do?" and, "Do ninjas still exist?" It is with the last thought that I begin to realize that ADHD is truly a part of my existence.</p>
